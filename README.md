## 👋 About Me  
Hi, my name is **Rokas**. Since the beginning of 2024, I have been studying and practicing to become a **QA Tester**. I am excited to have finally found a field where I can continuously develop my skills.  

Technology has fascinated me since childhood, and **Quality Assurance (QA)** allows me to contribute to making the digital world more user-friendly. In this portfolio, I aim to showcase my **knowledge of QA** and **practical skills** gained through courses, self-study, and work experience. My main focus right now is on expanding my **technical expertise** and gaining more **hands-on experience** in testing.
